**Create, deploy, and manage enterprise data pipelines**

## What is this book about?
Microsoft Azure Databricks helps you to harness the power of distributed computing and apply it to create robust data pipelines, along with training and deploying machine learning and deep learning models. Databricks' advanced features enable developers to process, transform, and explore data. Distributed Data Systems with Azure Databricks will help you to put your knowledge of Databricks to work to create big data pipelines.

The book provides a hands-on approach to implementing Azure Databricks and its associated methodologies that will make you productive in no time. Complete with detailed explanations of essential concepts, practical examples, and self-assessment questions, you’ll begin with a quick introduction to Databricks core functionalities, before performing distributed model training and inference using TensorFlow and Spark MLlib. As you advance, you’ll explore MLflow Model Serving on Azure Databricks and implement distributed training pipelines using HorovodRunner in Databricks.

Finally, you’ll discover how to transform, use, and obtain insights from massive amounts of data to train predictive models and create entire fully working data pipelines. By the end of this MS Azure book, you’ll have gained a solid understanding of how to work with Databricks to create and manage an entire big data pipeline.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Create ETLs for big data in Azure Databricks
* Train, manage, and deploy machine learning and deep learning models
* Integrate Databricks with Azure Data Factory for extract, transform, load (ETL) pipeline creation
* Discover how to use Horovod for distributed deep learning
* Find out how to use Delta Engine to query and process data from Delta Lake
* Understand how to use Data Factory in combination with Databricks
* Use Structured Streaming in a production-like environment

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 50)
y = np.sin(x)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, y, 'k--')
ax.set_xlim((0, 2*np.pi))
ax.set_xticks([0, np.pi, 2*np.pi])
ax.set_xticklabels(['0', '$\pi$','2$\pi$'])
ax.set_ylim((-1.5, 1.5))
ax.set_yticks([-1, 0, 1])
display(fig)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book helps you to learn how to extract, transform, and orchestrate massive amounts of data to develop robust data pipelines. You'll perform complex machine learning tasks using advanced Azure Databricks features, and also explore model tuning, deployment, and control using Databricks functionalities such as AutoML and Delta Lake with TensorFlow.
